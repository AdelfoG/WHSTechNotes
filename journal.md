Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Letâ€™s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

For Me: What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
yes, it was super werid because im still getting use to the whole entire entry of GitHub journel codeing. 
For You: Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?
I tend to miss understand the whole objectigve and sometimes I tend to misinterpert the things im supposed to do for this class.

In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
It's kind of odd since any small error messes up the whole entire code. Sometimes those small errors aren't even small but big. My experience with is werid because the most experience I've had was Snap, HTTMl coding, and computer typing classes. Rather than that it's confussing but I feel like if I have more practice I will truly get it.
