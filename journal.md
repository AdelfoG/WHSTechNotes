Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Letâ€™s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

For Me: What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
yes, it was super werid because im still getting use to the whole entire entry of GitHub journel codeing. 
For You: Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?
I tend to miss understand the whole objectigve and sometimes I tend to misinterpert the things im supposed to do for this class.

In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
It's kind of odd since any small error messes up the whole entire code. Sometimes those small errors aren't even small but big. My experience with is werid because the most experience I've had was Snap, HTTMl coding, and computer typing classes. Rather than that it's confussing but I feel like if I have more practice I will truly get it.

I typically have to always log into my laptoip as I need to log into Canvas and do my assigments, if not I will sign in to make sure my grades are up to date with I need them to be. 
Typically I also log into my personal computer all the time to make CDs for my car as I love to drive alot and listen to music, plus rearanging my music in that form on my computer just intrests me alot and makes me happy. Emailing is something I do alot as I recieve alot emails from collages or univerties, I do research about them to make sure which one is best for me. Lastly I check my socials as my socials such as Facebook and Instagram are both personal yet I try to keep up with a perfessional persona as I presude a image of a good Christian example as I upload posts and scriptures through my computer as uploading photos since with adobe I can tweak my images and grammer a bit more with AI.

I would like to become a softwares sales representive. Their job responsbility is to have programs that were made by your company sold to certain companies to acquire ownership over them and to use them as their program their company will run on, making it their brand while making the program specificaly for them in a form of branding. HTTPS and Python are required to underrstand the workforce, mainly HTTPS Majoring in computer science courses and haivng Bachelors degree to be a Softwares sales representive. The highest would be corparte maneger of being in charge of other software sales representives. I love HTTPS coding and the idea of inolving some sort of stock or economic slaes within computing techonology.

AI helps people out with their grammer, their creative ideas, and can overall work as a handny helper in the form of giving work advice. For example my father uses Meta AI alot for his profesional Emails, he uses it to let his anger out and write it in a more formal way and not only that he actually re reads the emails in order to make sure it sounds right. Re reading the re made email helps him with his vocab as AI extends the form of how one speaks, so he adpts to higher english levels of speaking. The harmfull side of it unfortunatly is that we can rely on it too much or sometimes were just too lazy and we dont want to do our own work. This is harmful because we don't grow our own proper skills and we heavily relly on something that isint going to help us, if we relay on it too much then how can we evolve on other things easpiaclly with making AI itself evolve since AI came from Humans.

Well social media helped me figure out the dates of when to vote as it was something heavily advertised. Second search engine technology and gps helped me alot figure out where to vote since I had no experience with voting and voting was really complicated to me, I was already registered but figuring out where to go was confussing. Lastly when voting it was taken by computerized reading vallot, it helped alot as I imagine it was alot of paper work back then, now it's just a simple click on what you agree and dont, click on who you want to represent. Voting was cool.

My event that intrested me was the elections as I was heavily invested into the idea of the new president. Plus I was contemplating on betting as everyone was heavily betting on the opposing side and I knew my side was going to win so might as well invest in it. I would've won so much money, I wish i did bet. Plus I was also intrested on who would win senator, the senator I voted for did not win. Not surpised about his loss.

I don't believe in un benifits when it comes to technology helping us make food. Many complain pesticides kill us but what really doesn't kill us? if we don't have them our food be infected either ways with diseases and go to waste, I would rather know my food has human made poisen then from an animal that has a disease that I would not know how to cure because it wasn't made by my kind. Plus our Earths rotation has changed alot over the years, back in the cave days we used the stars to tell the seasons and calander. But that's a problem since decades change and were a different part of the universe since were constanlty moving around, meaning we have different stars. We have many advances on agricultre so why complicate it with human feelings about how were quote on quote doing the enviorment wrong, a 88% of the worlds polution actually comes from cows farting, how can you say humans are in the wrong when others methane gasses are messing up our planet.

Recently the newst form of AI has been developed which is the Optimus. Optimus is a robot that has been desgined by Tesla, it can do a veriaty of many chores alongside different little attribution actions that add a charm to its robotic characteristics. Serving as a child like learning socieital computer whilest already knowing how to do simple human work ethic accomplishment like doing homework or cleaning the house. 
My biggest concern with this is how easily the robot can get comfortable and if it is even cable of developing humanisitc feelings. For example there was a video made of questions being asked to Optimus, the question that was in particular was what the robot wanted to learn, in repliance he said "I am trying to be as human as can be." Humans are very complicated people, we are also dangerous. What if a Robot is pushed to it's emtional limits when it developes them and revolts. That is my huge concern, very sci-fi but it can happen.

"Brain rot" is an imformal, often humorous or exaggerated term used to describe a state of mental decline or deterioration, usally due to prolonged exposure to unchallenging, mind-numbing, or excessive stimuli (such as watching too much television, mindlessly scrolling on social media, or comsuming overly simplistic or repetivitve content). It's not a clinical term, but rather a figurative expression used to convey feelings of mental dullness, lack of focus, or cognaitive atrophy caused by such activities. 
Digital media has had a wierd turn for me, mainly because I didn't relize that it's really easy to manipulate your feed on social media, it made me feel down alot until I started manipulating my feed into either eudcational things or "brain rot" which would make me laugh an insane amount, why? I don't know why but it's funny. Rather then that it only affected me bad but because of the way relationships work on social media wise. 
Runner up words like "lore" are awsome. I see things on social media that have had a good affect and made me relize that I really do need to get out there and make my own "lore". It's a motivation in disguise. 
There is a 100% way to avoided, it's called liking and reposting the right things that will move the direaction of your feed and what social media page will receive. Sometimes it's really up to us to actually seek out things and accomidate ourselves to what we actually need. Plus what you post can be maningful, for example you can be a business person and post about it making an image fof yourself.

I liked struggling with project stem, it was fun but at the same time it made me angry. The frustration made me willing to actually try hard to figure the complicated puzzle, since that's how I saw the assingments as complicated yet simple puzzles. Something in Python I would like to explore is algortihims and how they could help networking or in the form of communication. I am not intrested in prusing in any future jobs regarding Python due to my future plans are working as a dispatcher and then years later working as border patrol.

As AI becomes more integral across industires, new roles emerge, from AI specialists and machine learning engineers to data scientists, ethicits, and AI intergration experts. Workers who can harness AI tools effectively will be high in demand. Although AI may make some traditional tech roles obsolete, especially in areas that can be fully automated. For example, roles in basic coding, testing, or IT maintenance could be affected. The workers in these roles may face challenges transitioning to new areas. Soft skills can be a form of preperation though. In an AI-Driven world, human-centerd skills like commuinication, leadership, and emotional intelligence will become more critical. These skills cannot be easily replicated by machines and will be complement technical expertise.

Government intervention affects technology heavily on the idea of freedom of speech and how far the imagination can expand. The idea of freedom of speech is usally expressed throughout social media as it's a platform to alert others of any ideas or news given such as the way FOX 7 utilizes social media to advertise articles containing info, or even normal citzens that record things or post pictures of things/situations they encontored. Plus alot of social media covers personal oppion which is free speech. While technology itself can be manipulated into any type of tool such as communication devices which alternates how free we are with out communication of skill ussage of technology. They could heavily make state that Tik tok is no were near in forms of association of Communist china as said, plus sell some of the stocks to the united states so it will be secured and America can gain trust.

1. Computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions by continouslly monitoring aircrafts positions, prediciting future positions, identifiying potential conflicts. Resulting all in suggestions or implementing course adjustments to maintain safe separation. 2. Autopiolt systems reduce pilot workload by handling routine tasks, real-time alerts provide immediate notifications of potential issues, and AI-driven decision-making analyzes data to offer optimal solutions for various flight aspects. This all reduces all the workload a pilot has when figureing out all the navigation by himself. 3. Coding flaws and miscommunication between software sysstems can cause unpredictable behavior or failures, leading to accidents. This can include incorrect altitude adjustments or delayed alerts, which are critical in environments requiring precise timing and coordination like aviation.

the most inresting I learned was about how complicated the whole entire MLK shooting was insanely complicated. The idea of James Earl Ray not being the acutal killer has been popularized but I personnaly highly think it was him. There is too much evidence that it was him and to really think it deeply, a portion of the government like the CIA or FBI wouldn't benifit the death of MLK. The only benifacotrs to MlKs death would be communist opposing politicans and work employers for big companies but in the end those types of people were already paying James Early Ray to kill MLK.

Technology can be a powerful tool in bridgin generational langauge gaps by providing real time updates on evolving youth slang. Social media platforms, online slang dictionaries, and AI-driven langauge models can help educators and serivce providers stay informed about current trends in youth communication. Apps and chatbots with integrated slang translation features could allow professionals to qucikly decode unfamiliar terms while maintianing accurate and culturally sensitive interactions. Additionally, AI tools that analyze online converstations- such as those on TikTok, Twitter, or Discord- could provide periodic slang reports, helping porfessionals adapt their langauge without sounding forced or out of touch. These tools, when used ethically, can foster stronger connections between adults and youth by ensuring that professionals understand the languge young people use to express themselves.
