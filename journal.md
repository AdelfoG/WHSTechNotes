Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Letâ€™s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

For Me: What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
yes, it was super werid because im still getting use to the whole entire entry of GitHub journel codeing. 
For You: Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?
I tend to miss understand the whole objectigve and sometimes I tend to misinterpert the things im supposed to do for this class.

In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
It's kind of odd since any small error messes up the whole entire code. Sometimes those small errors aren't even small but big. My experience with is werid because the most experience I've had was Snap, HTTMl coding, and computer typing classes. Rather than that it's confussing but I feel like if I have more practice I will truly get it.

I typically have to always log into my laptoip as I need to log into Canvas and do my assigments, if not I will sign in to make sure my grades are up to date with I need them to be. 
Typically I also log into my personal computer all the time to make CDs for my car as I love to drive alot and listen to music, plus rearanging my music in that form on my computer just intrests me alot and makes me happy. Emailing is something I do alot as I recieve alot emails from collages or univerties, I do research about them to make sure which one is best for me. Lastly I check my socials as my socials such as Facebook and Instagram are both personal yet I try to keep up with a perfessional persona as I presude a image of a good Christian example as I upload posts and scriptures through my computer as uploading photos since with adobe I can tweak my images and grammer a bit more with AI.

Their job responsbility is to have programs that were made by your company sold to certain companies to acquire ownership over them and to use them as their program their company will run on, making it their brand while making the program specificaly for them in a form of branding. HTTPS and Python are required to underrstand the workforce, mainly HTTPS Majoring in computer science courses and haivng Bachelors degree to be a Softwares sales representive. The highest would be corparte maneger of being in charge of other software sales representives. I love HTTPS coding and the idea of inolving some sort of stock or economic slaes within computing techonology.

AI helps people out with their grammer, their creative ideas, and can overall work as a handny helper in the form of giving work advice. For example my father uses Meta AI alot for his profesional Emails, he uses it to let his anger out and write it in a more formal way and not only that he actually re reads the emails in order to make sure it sounds right. Re reading the re made email helps him with his vocab as AI extends the form of how one speaks, so he adpts to higher english levels of speaking. The harmfull side of it unfortunatly is that we can rely on it too much or sometimes were just too lazy and we dont want to do our own work. This is harmful because we don't grow our own proper skills and we heavily relly on something that isint going to help us, if we relay on it too much then how can we evolve on other things easpiaclly with making AI itself evolve since AI came from Humans.

Well social media helped me figure out the dates of when to vote as it was something heavily advertised. Second search engine technology and gps helped me alot figure out where to vote since I had no experience with voting and voting was really complicated to me, I was already registered but figuring out where to go was confussing. Lastly when voting it was taken by computerized reading vallot, it helped alot as I imagine it was alot of paper work back then, now it's just a simple click on what you agree and dont, click on who you want to represent. Voting was cool.
