Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Letâ€™s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

For Me: What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
yes, it was super werid because im still getting use to the whole entire entry of GitHub journel codeing. 
For You: Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?
I tend to miss understand the whole objectigve and sometimes I tend to misinterpert the things im supposed to do for this class.

In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
It's kind of odd since any small error messes up the whole entire code. Sometimes those small errors aren't even small but big. My experience with is werid because the most experience I've had was Snap, HTTMl coding, and computer typing classes. Rather than that it's confussing but I feel like if I have more practice I will truly get it.

I typically have to always log into my laptoip as I need to log into Canvas and do my assigments, if not I will sign in to make sure my grades are up to date with I need them to be. 
Typically I also log into my personal computer all the time to make CDs for my car as I love to drive alot and listen to music, plus rearanging my music in that form on my computer just intrests me alot and makes me happy. Emailing is something I do alot as I recieve alot emails from collages or univerties, I do research about them to make sure which one is best for me. Lastly I check my socials as my socials such as Facebook and Instagram are both personal yet I try to keep up with a perfessional persona as I presude a image of a good Christian example as I upload posts and scriptures through my computer as uploading photos since with adobe I can tweak my images and grammer a bit more with AI.
